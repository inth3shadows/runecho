# RunEcho Workflow

- This repo uses RunEcho as the code-truth source for symbol existence and structural drift questions.
- Use the `runecho` MCP server before making claims about what functions, classes, exports, or imports exist.
- If RunEcho reports stale or missing baseline data, run `runecho-ir repo reindex <name>` before trusting structural answers.
- Treat unresolved-symbol findings from `runecho-guard` as verification stops until they are fixed or intentionally explained.
